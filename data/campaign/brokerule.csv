Yunifer's face is illuminated by these lights, enough to see tears falling down her face. You rush over, nearly tripping over yourself. The sound of your crew shouting orders and blaring alarms flood in. Yunifer turns towards you...



Her smile is brighter than any of the lights on the world.

For once, neither of you pay attention to the sounds on the Laputeus. You dance together to the sound of exploding antimatter fuel.",,
