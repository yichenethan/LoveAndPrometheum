ShowImageVisual urban02","After settling into your seat, you take a moment to glance outside the shuttle through one of the windows. Passing through one of the openings into the underground of Sindria, you notice that compared to other visits, the bombardment of music and advertisement has not hit you. It's a strange feeling, but a feeling you appreciate being able to hear yourself think for once.

Passing through the main entrace into the underground proper, your shuttle drifts past the main areas of the underground city, passing by countless underground habitation acrologies and industrial centers. Your pilot brings to your attention your destination, a fancier looking arcology away from the hustle and bustle from the majority of the city. It even looks like it hasn't been touched by the Board of Advertisement and Marketing. Reaching one of the landing pads, you see someone already waiting for you.

As you step out of the shuttle, you hearing a jovial laugh as Gregory Mannfred approaches you with a beaming smile. ""Ah, Captain $PlayerName! It's so good to see you in the flesh! Come, come, let's head inside.""","mannnep2:Follow Mannfred",
mannsuperfightermeeting2,DialogOptionSelected,"$option == mannnep2","BeginConversation sfcmann true true","You follow Mannfred inside through the lobby, the Lead Developer waving his credentials to the receptionist and bringing you through a gated entrance. Passing through, you find yourself inside a rather intricate artificial environment, designed to look like a normal, surface environment. With an artifical skyline with simulated sun along with, you believe to be, simulated plants and greenery, you barely have time to soak it in as you are shuffled along.

""Nice, isn't it?"" Mannfred remarks as he guides you up a flight of stairs and down a row of similar looking apartment doors. ""Almost makes you think you're not living several thousands of feet below ground. Ah, here we are, my home!""

Stopping in front of a door, Mannfred taps his ID against the touchpad, a light beep causing the door to slowly open up. ""Come inside, make yourself at home, I'll get us some drinks!""

Stepping inside, you find Mannfred's home to be a rather well-furnished, if somewhat utilitarian in design. You quickly take a seat on one of the stools next to a kitchen counter top as Mannfred returns with a bottle and a pair of drinking glasses.

""So, care for a drink?""

The Lead Developer then takes a seat next to you. ""So, $PlayerName, I'm glad you could come here. I know it must be quite a busy thing going around the Persean Sector doing all sorts of stuff. But it's always important we take a moment to have a break, no? So consider this an offer: Feel free to come visit me here whenever you want in the future. A Captain deserves a place where they can relax and feel at ease, and I would be happy to be able to offer you something like this.""

mannsuperfightermeeting4,DialogOptionSelected,"$option == mannnep4",,"The two of you spend hours trading stories and adventures, with Mannfred himself talking about how he ended up with the Sindrian Fuel Company and how he ended up in the position he is today. As the rest of the visit continues, Mannfred continues to refill his glass, with him on his third refill before long.

""... And that's how I ended up having to call an ambulance to bring Balashi to a doctor after I told him that I thought that the latest commercial with Andrada in it made him look like he was asleep!"" Mannfred laughs as he slams his hand on the counter top several times. ""Ah, good times that was, good times. Oh and speaking of times, look at the time! Anyway, I actually had something I wanted to show you as well.""

Mannfred then brings up an image on his TriPad, expanding a holographic image out for you to see. ""I've been working on developing a new fighter for the Sindrian Fuel Company. However, since the Company has been rather... obstinate when it comes to adopting new fighter designs. But I know it's good and all I need is for proof how good it is! So that's where you come in, $PlayerName. I want you to take this design and use it in your fleet and gather as much combat data as you can with it! Once the Sindrian Fuel Company sees just how successful it is, they'll have to adopt it into the fleet itself! It'll be perfect. And I'll even let you make your own copies if you want!

You can see yourself out, the receptionist will help you out, and I'll make sure there's a shuttle ready to pick up.

Mannfred waves good-bye as you leave the apartment, heading back out to the landing pad you came in fromt. Before long, another VIP shuttle arrives to pick you up. Taking a seat inside, the shuttle lifts off and heads off, leaving the residental arcology behind.","cutCommLink:Return back to your fleet",
